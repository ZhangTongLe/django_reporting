一.Models
(一)Introduction to models
1.
Each model is a Python class that subclasses django.db.models.Model
Each attribute of the model represents a database field
2.Quick example
(1)
from django.db import models
class Person(models.Model):
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)

3.using modles
(1)the package structure that is created for an application by the manage.py startapp script
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    #...
    'myapp',
    #...
]
(2)When you add new apps to INSTALLED_APPS, be sure to run manage.py migrate, optionally making migrations for them first with manage.py makemigrations.
3.Fields
(1) not to choose field names that conflict with the models API like clean, save, or delete.
(2)两个表的关系:
from django.db import models

class Musician(models.Model):
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    instrument = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Album(models.Model):
    artist = models.ForeignKey(Musician, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    release_date = models.DateField()
    num_stars = models.IntegerField()
